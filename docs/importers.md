# Importers

Every importer produces normalized **executions** (fills). Trade-level exports are
reconstructed as one entry + one exit execution at the reported average prices. P&L is
preserved exactly; fill-level granularity is not (the warning says so on import).

Nothing is guessed silently: a file that doesn't match a known signature goes to the
column mapper, where the user maps their own headers.

## Formats and validation status

Parsers are **alias-driven**: every column is matched through a list of header aliases,
so fixing a drifted header is a one-line change.

Two validation tiers:

- **Cross-checked**: header set verified against _field sources_, meaning code that
  parses real user exports in the wild (TradeNote's community broker parsers¹, a
  real-user TradeZella converter², platform export docs), with fixtures in
  `packages/importers/tests` shaped from those sources.
- **Real file**: verified against an actual export file from a live account
  (the most valuable contribution this repo can receive).

¹ [TradeNote community broker parsers](https://github.com/Eleven-Trading/TradeNote/blob/main/src/utils/brokers.js):
real-user headers for Tradovate (`Fill Time`, `B/S`, `Filled Qty`, `Avg Fill Price`,
`Status=Filled`), TopstepX (`FilledAt`, `Side=Bid/Ask`, `PositionDisposition`,
`ExecutePrice`, `Size`), NinjaTrader (`Instrument`, `Action`, `E/X`, `$`-prefixed
`Commission`), IBKR Flex (`Date/Time` as `YYYYMMDD;HHmmss`, `Buy/Sell`, negative
`Commission`), ThinkorSwim section boundaries.
² [TradeZella_STB converter](https://github.com/drasticstatic/TradeZella_STB):
confirms `Open Date`, `Status` (win/loss), `Net P&L`, `trades_*.csv` filename, and
custom journal columns; TradeZella's own docs confirm timezone abbreviations may ride
in time fields (stripped by our date parser).
³ Tradervue's published generic format: `Date, Time, Symbol, Quantity, Price, Side` +
`Commission`/`TransFee`/`ECNFee`; TradingView's export docs: `Symbol, Side, Qty,
Fill Price, Closing Time` (+ optional `Type`, `Status`, `Commission`).

Known variants NOT yet handled (send a sample!): MetaTrader 5 xlsx "Trade History
Report" (the MT4-style `.htm` statement works), TradeZella exports with custom column
selections beyond the defaults.

## Sharp edges the parsers handle

- Quoted fields, embedded commas/newlines, BOM, `;`/tab delimiters (RFC 4180 parser,
  zero dependencies)
- `$1,234.56`, `(45.20)` negatives, European `1.234,56` decimals
- Naive timestamps interpreted in the **user's timezone** (DST-safe two-pass
  conversion), explicit offsets honored as-is
- TradeZella P&L reconciliation: when stated net P&L differs from price-implied gross
  minus commissions, the difference is folded into fees so imported history agrees with
  the trader's old numbers to the cent (skipped when a contract multiplier makes the
  price-implied gross meaningless)
- Content-hash dedup on insert: re-importing the same file is a no-op

## Adding a format

1. Add a spec to `packages/importers/src/formats/`; most CSVs are a declarative
   `makeFillsFormat({...})` with header aliases.
2. Register it in `src/detect.ts` (content-signature formats before header-signature
   ones).
3. Add a fixture test in `tests/importers.test.ts` with a real (anonymized) export.
